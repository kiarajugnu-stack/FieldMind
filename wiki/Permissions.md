1. Grant only essential permissions (Storage, Audio Settings)
2. Deny optional permissions if you don't need features:
   - Internet → No online lyrics/artwork
   - Bluetooth → No wireless audio auto-play
   - Notifications → No playback controls in shade

### Use Firewall (Advanced)
Block internet access if you want offline-only:
- **[NetGuard](https://netguard.me/)**: No-root firewall
- **[AFWall+](https://github.com/ukanth/afwall)**: Requires root
- **[RethinkDNS](https://rethinkdns.com/)**: DNS + Firewall

### Scoped Storage (Android 11+)
Rhythm uses **Scoped Storage** on Android 11+:
- Access limited to music files only
- No access to documents, photos, or other file types
- Enhanced privacy and security

## ❓ FAQ

### Why does Rhythm need internet access?
For optional online features: lyrics (LRCLib), artwork (Deezer), and updates (GitHub). The app works fully offline without internet.

### Can I use Rhythm without granting notifications?
Yes, but you won't see playback controls in the notification shade. Player screen still works normally.

### Does Rhythm access my photos?
No. Even though `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` is requested (for album art embedded in music files), Rhythm only accesses images associated with audio files, not your photo gallery.

### Why Bluetooth permissions?
To detect when you connect Bluetooth headphones/speakers and auto-resume playback. Optional feature.

### Is my listening data sent anywhere?
**No.** Rhythm stores all data locally on your device. Nothing is uploaded or shared.

### Can I audit the code?
**Yes!** Rhythm is fully open-source: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/cromaguy/Rhythm)
